# Historic Places - Simplified
Based on Plaiades Dataset "Places"

*as of 4th November 2021*

The aim is to provide a searchable location file of well known historic cities (settlements). This file is not totally cleaned, not researched in detail, and will not be upated very often.

But the advatage is that it provides (me with) a dataset of city names that can be used in various other softwares.

From the source, I deleted details that is not needed to find and place a location. All that"s left is: lat/long, city name, as well as start-year/end-year.

## Example
I use this in AfterEffects for animating maps. If I want to find the correct location of Babylon, I would have to click around the internet, Wikipedia, GoogleMaps, OpenStreetmap > then write down Lat/Long > copy/paste.

With this little file, I have the well known cities programatically at hand.

## Data quality disclaimer
I only checked a few places and they seemed correct. Good enough for my usecase, but I do not recommend this for scientific purposes.

Also - and sorry Pleiades Project - the whole dataset appears to be skewed towards *"Western / Eurpoean / Mid-Eastern"* history. I do not see any *"American"* points, and *"Asian / Indian / Central-East"* points only if for example Acient Greeks visited there.
